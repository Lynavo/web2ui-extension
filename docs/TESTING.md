# Testing guide

The repository tests the same seams used at runtime: contract validators, pure conversion
interfaces, injected adapters, and a real Manifest V3 browser flow.

## Validation levels

### Focused feedback

Run the nearest test while implementing:

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run tests/background-controller.test.ts
node --test tests/manifest-policy.test.mjs
```

Vitest owns TypeScript unit and E2E tests. Node's built-in test runner owns JavaScript build,
package, repository, manifest, and release-policy tests.

### Complete gate

```bash
pnpm validate
```

The complete gate runs:

1. production build;
2. TypeScript checking;
3. ESLint;
4. Node policy/build tests;
5. Vitest unit tests;
6. the real Chromium extension flow;
7. final local-only release-boundary verification.

Run it before handing off any code, dependency, manifest, build, or release change.

### Release gate

```bash
pnpm audit
pnpm validate
pnpm package
```

Packaging rebuilds and verifies the extension, creates `out/releases/web2ui-extension-<version>.zip`,
writes its SHA-256 checksum, and generates an SPDX 2.3 production-dependency SBOM.

## Suite ownership

| Suite | What it protects |
| --- | --- |
| `core-capture-*.test.ts` | Browser measurement, sanitization, asset safety, and capture-contract facts. |
| `core-contracts.test.ts` | Runtime validation of CaptureDocument and RenderPlan. |
| `core-conversion*.test.ts` | Pure geometry, paint, text, assets, and clipboard output. |
| `content-*.test.ts` | Capture orchestration, scrolling, fallbacks, cleanup, and asset bounds. |
| `background-*.test.ts` | Privileged Chrome adapters and controller behavior. |
| `state-machine.test.ts` | Allowed state transitions and stale-run rejection. |
| `local-plan-store.test.ts` | IndexedDB validation, size limit, single-record policy, and expiry. |
| `popup-*.test.ts(x)` | Capture options, clipboard fallbacks, and rendered popup behavior. |
| `message-protocol.test.ts` | Strict popup/content message interfaces. |
| `*.test.mjs` | Build, manifest, repository, packaging, and release invariants. |
| `tests/e2e/local-copy-flow.test.ts` | Real visible/full-page capture, clipboard payloads, local-only traffic, and service-worker restart. |

## E2E artifacts

The browser test builds `dist/`, starts a loopback synthetic page, loads the unpacked extension in
Chromium, and writes evidence under:

```text
out/e2e/playwright/local-copy/
```

The test verifies both capture modes, popup behavior, viewport/theme choices, clipboard
preparation, result survival across a service-worker restart, and absence of capture data sent to
a Web2UI host. The browser profile and screenshots are disposable and must not be committed.

## Writing reliable tests

- Prefer synthetic HTML and deterministic adapters over live websites.
- Test a module through its public interface; do not duplicate its implementation in assertions.
- Assert cleanup and failure behavior, not only success.
- Use explicit run, tab, and document identities in message tests.
- Keep conversion tests free of Chrome and filesystem dependencies.
- Keep captures, cookies, credentials, personal data, and third-party copyrighted page assets out
  of fixtures.
- For regressions, make the focused test fail before changing the implementation.

## Common failures

- **Chromium cannot launch:** ensure Playwright's Chromium is installed for the current lockfile
  and retry `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
- **Extension does not reflect a rebuild:** reload its card on `chrome://extensions`; an already
  open popup may still belong to the previous service worker.
- **E2E timeout:** inspect the latest files under `out/e2e/playwright/local-copy/` and rerun the E2E
  file alone.
- **Release-boundary failure:** read the reported file and pattern. Do not relax a rule merely to
  pass; confirm whether the change violates local-only scope, manifest policy, or artifact
  hygiene. The reviewed commercial website link is allowlisted only in its source component and
  compiled popup; popup network primitives and the same origin elsewhere still fail closed.
